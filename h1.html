<p>There are many variations of passages of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
If you are going to use a passage of  <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> , you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
<p> All the  <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>  generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
